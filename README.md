# Obstacle Avoidance And Line Following Bot

This repository contains the necessary files to build an Obstacle Avoidance and Line Following Bot using Arduino, infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors and a motor driver module. The project includes the Proteus schematic and simulation files along with Arduino code and libraries for the infrared sensors.

## Overview

This project aims to create a versatile robot capable of both line following and obstacle avoidance tasks. The robot utilizes infrared sensors to detect obstacles and follow lines, making it suitable for various applications such as maze-solving, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and more.

## Contents

- **Proteus Files**: Contains the schematic and simulation files for the robot's circuitry designed in Proteus.
- **Arduino Code**: Includes the Arduino sketch for controlling the robot's behavior, integrating both obstacle avoidance and line following algorithms.
- **Libraries**: Houses the necessary libraries for interfacing with the infrared sensors used in the project.

## Components Required

- Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Infrared Sensors
- Motor Driver module
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- DC Motors
- Power Supply

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/Obstacle-Avoidance-And-Line-Following-Bot.git
    ```

2. **Open Proteus Files**: Use Proteus Design Suite to open the schematic and simulation files provided in the `Proteus Files` directory. This will allow you to visualize the circuitry and simulate the robot's behavior.

3. **Upload Arduino Code**: Upload the Arduino Hex file to Proteus project.

4. **Run Simulation**: In Proteus, run the simulation to observe the behavior of the robot. You should see it performing both obstacle avoidance and line following tasks.

## Usage

Once you have uploaded the Arduino code and set up the hardware as per the schematic, you can use the robot for various applications. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to adjust parameters in the Arduino code to fine-tune the robot's behavior.
